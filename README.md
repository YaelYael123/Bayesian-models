<div align=justify> The Bayesian Models crash is a course I studied in the fourth year, and it included probabilistic programming in order to enable the implementation of Bayesian models. The course is designed to enable practical solutions to machine learning problems such as predictions and classifications. <br>
The course included an introduction to PyMC, an environment of probabilistic features, MCMC algorithms and its applications, Bayesian optimization using Gaussian processes (GP) and valuable applications.</div>
<br>
<div align=justify> In the repository you can find the two papers that were prepared for the course project and are under the folder 'solved notebooks'.<br>
Mathball is an assignment done as a sport analytic. The job is to give predictions for the next Mathball tournament of the Six finest mathematicians.<br>
Queuing_quiz is an assignment where we were in charge of the queuing system in the workplace. In this assignment weâ€™ve focused on automation using the Gaussian process. </div>
